## Problem 1

``` r
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE)

library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(base)

set.seed(77)
df <- tibble(random_sample = rnorm(8,mean = 0, sd =1),
            gr_th_0 = random_sample > 0,
            num_char = as.character(c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)),
            level = factor(c("Low", "Medium","High","Low","Medium","High","Medium","High"))
            )

#Taking the mean of all variables 
mean(pull(df, random_sample))
```

    ## [1] 0.3036115

``` r
mean(pull(df, gr_th_0))
```

    ## [1] 0.625

``` r
mean(pull(df, num_char))
```

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(df, level))
```

    ## [1] NA

The mean function cannot compute mean for variables num\_char and level
because they are non numerical variables (character, factor, etc.). The
mean function computes the mean for variables random\_sample and
gr\_th\_0 because random\_sample is a numerical variable and gr\_th\_0
is a logic vector, which could be interpreted as 0 and 1.

``` r
as.numeric(
        pull(df,num_char)
)
as.numeric(
        pull(df,level)
)
as.numeric(
        pull(df,gr_th_0)
)
```

Applying the as.numeric function to the logical, factor, and character
variables gives the elements in the original character vector (1,2,…8)
in numerical form, corresponds “Low”, “Medium”, “High” to numbers 2,3,1,
and corresponds 0,1 to False, True". It did this because as.numeric
turns factor, logical, and character vectors into numeric vectors. This
helps explain how the means couldn’t be computed for character and
factor vectors because they were non-numerical values.

## Problem 2

``` r
#convert character variable into numeric
num_char <- as.numeric(
            pull(df,num_char)
)

#mutiply the converted numerical variable with random sample
num_char * pull(df,random_sample)
```

    ## [7] -6.7938814 -1.0546182

``` r
#convert the logical vector to a factor
gr_th_0_factor <- as.factor(
                     pull(df,gr_th_0)
)

#mutiply result with random sample
gr_th_0_factor * pull(df,random_sample)
```

    ## Warning in Ops.factor(gr_th_0_factor, pull(df, random_sample)): '*' not
    ## meaningful for factors

    ## [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
#convert logical vector to a factor and to numeric
gr_th_0_num <- as.numeric(
                      as.factor(
                          pull(df,gr_th_0)
))

#mutiply result with random sample
gr_th_0_num * pull(df,random_sample)
```

    ## [7] -0.9705545 -0.1318273

``` r
library(tidyverse)
set.seed(123)
df_1 <- tibble(x = rnorm(500, mean = 0, sd = 1),
               y = rnorm(500, mean = 0, sd = 1), 
               gr_th_1 = x + y > 1,
               logic_num = as.numeric(gr_th_1),
               logic_factor = as.factor(logic_num)
               )
```

The dataset has 500 rows and 5 columns. The mean of proportion of cases
for which x + y \> 1 is 4.5610^{-4}

``` r
df_1 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, color = gr_th_1)) + 
  geom_point() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

The scatterplots color-coded by the original logical vector,
“factorized” logical vector, and “numericalized” logical vector are
the same, because the variable is binary to beging with, and then
numericalizing this logical vector just converts “TRUE” and “FALSE” into
1 and 0. Despite being presented on a continuous scale from 0 to 1, the
actual values are still just binary (0 and 1) as shown on the
scatterplot with logic\_num. Meanwhile, as.factor just turns this
numerical logical vector (0,1 as numbers) back to factors, or levels of
“0” and “1” (still binary, and thus only two colors for all datapoints
in the scatterplot with logic factor).
