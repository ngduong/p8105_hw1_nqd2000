## Problem 1

``` r
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE)

library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(base)

#set seed for random sampling
set.seed(77)

#create tibble dataframe containing a sample of 8 following a normal distribution with mean = 0 and sd = 1 
df <- tibble(random_sample = rnorm(8,mean = 0, sd =1),
            #logical vector for if each element is greater than 0 
            gr_th_0 = random_sample > 0, 
            #make a character vector of length 8
            num_char = as.character(c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)), 
            #make a factor vector of length 8
            level = factor(c("Low", "Medium","High","Low","Medium","High","Medium","High")) 
            )

#Taking the mean of all vectors in tibble dataframe df
mean(pull(df, random_sample))
```

    ## [1] 0.3036115

``` r
mean(pull(df, gr_th_0))
```

    ## [1] 0.625

``` r
mean(pull(df, num_char))
```

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(df, level))
```

    ## [1] NA

The mean function cannot compute mean for variables num\_char and level
because they are non numerical variables (character, factor, etc.). The
mean function computes the mean for variables random\_sample and
gr\_th\_0 because random\_sample is a numerical variable and gr\_th\_0
is a logic vector, which could be interpreted as 0 and 1.

``` r
#turn character variable "num_char" into numerical variable
as.numeric(
        pull(df,num_char)
)

#turn factor vector "level" into numerical variable
as.numeric(
        pull(df,level)
)

#turn logical vector "gr_th_0" into numerical variable
as.numeric(
        pull(df,gr_th_0)
)
```

Applying the as.numeric function to the logical, factor, and character
variables gives the elements in the original character vector (1,2,…8)
in numerical form, corresponds “Low”, “Medium”, “High” to numbers 2,3,1,
and corresponds 0,1 to False, True". It did this because as.numeric
turns factor, logical, and character vectors into numeric vectors. This
helps explain how the means couldn’t be computed for character and
factor vectors because they were non-numerical values.

## Problem 2

``` r
#convert character variable into numeric
num_char <- as.numeric(
            pull(df,num_char)
)

#mutiply the converted numerical variable with random sample
num_char * pull(df,random_sample)
```

    ## [7] -6.7938814 -1.0546182

``` r
#convert the logical vector to a factor
gr_th_0_factor <- as.factor(
                     pull(df,gr_th_0)
)

#mutiply result with random sample
gr_th_0_factor * pull(df,random_sample)
```

    ## Warning in Ops.factor(gr_th_0_factor, pull(df, random_sample)): '*' not
    ## meaningful for factors

    ## [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
#convert logical vector to a factor and to numeric
gr_th_0_num <- as.numeric(
                      as.factor(
                          pull(df,gr_th_0)
))

#mutiply result with random sample
gr_th_0_num * pull(df,random_sample)
```

##set seed for random sample

##make a tibble dataframe with two random normal variables, a logical vector, and its numericalized and factorized form
df_1 <- tibble(x = rnorm(500, mean = 0, sd = 1), #sample following a normal distribution with mean = 0 and sd = 1
               y = rnorm(500, mean = 0, sd = 1), 
               #logical vector for sum greater than 1 
               gr_th_1 = x + y > 1, 
               #factorize above vector
               logic_num = as.numeric(gr_th_1), 
               #numericalize above vector
               logic_factor = as.factor(logic_num) 
               )
```

The dataset has 500 rows and 5 columns. The mean of proportion of cases
for which x + y \> 1 is 4.5610^{-4}

``` r
##create scatterplot of x and y color coded by logical vector
df_1 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, color = gr_th_1)) + 
  geom_point() ##dot for each datapoint +

The scatterplots color-coded by the original logical vector,
“factorized” logical vector, and “numericalized” logical vector are
the same, because the variable is binary to begin with, and then
numericalizing this logical vector just converts “TRUE” and “FALSE” into
1 and 0. Despite being presented on a continuous scale from 0 to 1 on
the legend, the actual values are still just binary (0 and 1) as shown
on the scatterplot with logic\_num. Meanwhile, as.factor just turns this
numerical logical vector (0,1 as numbers) back to factors, or levels of
“0” and “1” (still binary, and thus only two colors for all datapoints
in the scatterplot with logic factor).
